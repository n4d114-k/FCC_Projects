            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Umberto Eco's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1932</strong> - Eco was born on 5 January 1932 in the city of Alessandria, in Piedmont in northern Italy</li>
                <li><strong>1954</strong> - Umberto's father urged him to become a lawyer, but he entered the University of Turin to take up medieval philosophy and literature, writing his thesis on Thomas Aquinas and earning a Laurea degree in philosophy in 1954.</li>
                <li><strong>1956</strong> - A group of avant-garde artists, painters, musicians and writers, whom he had befriended at RAI (Gruppo 63), became an important and influential component in Eco's writing career. This was especially true after the publication of his first book in 1956, "Il problema estetico in San Tommaso", which was an extension of his Laurea thesis. This also marked the beginning of his lecturing career at his alma mater.</li>
                <li><strong>1962</strong> - In September 1962 he married Renate Ramge, a German art teacher with whom he had a son and a daughter.</li>
                <li><strong>1992</strong> - In 1992–1993 Eco was the Norton professor at Harvard University.</li>
                <li><strong>1993</strong> - On 8 May 1993, Eco received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL) from Indiana University Bloomington in recognition of his over fifteen-year association with the university's Research Center for Language and Semiotic Studies. Six books that were authored, co-authored, or co-edited by Eco were published by Indiana University Press.</li>
                <li><strong>1996</strong> - In 1996, he was appointed Honorary Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Tartu.</li>
                <li><strong>2001</strong> - He became Satrap of the Collège de 'Pataphysique in 2001.</li>
                <li><strong>2002</strong> - On 23 May 2002, Eco received an honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.</li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> -  In 2009, the University of Belgrade in Serbia awarded him an honorary doctorate.</li>
                <li><strong>2016</strong> - Eco died at his Milanese home, on the night of 19 February 2016. At the time of his death at the age of 84, he was a professor emeritus at the University of Bologna, a position that he had held since 2008.</li>

                 enigma that is made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as
                  though it had an underlying truth."
