# [APIs and Microservices Projects - File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice)

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this](https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks).

##### User Story 1
I can submit a form that includes a file upload.

##### User Story 2
The form file input field has the `name` attribute set to `upfile`.

##### User Story 3
When I submit something, I will receive the file `name`, `type`, and `size` in bytes within the JSON response.

#### Example usage:
* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.

#### Hint:
* To handle the file uploading you should use the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.
